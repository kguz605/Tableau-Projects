# Tableau-Projects
This repository contains projects I've created in Tableau. The purpose is to expand my data visualization skills and show off concepts that I've learned.
1. The first project you'll see is a dashboard exploring Netflix data. Some of the insights include top 10 Genres on Netflix, total number of movies and tv shows throughout the years, total tv shows and movies by country, and more.
